        <h1> Live Life With Passion!</h1>
        <h2> Enjoy life and stay active--.</h2>
        <p> Everything I do in life, I do with a purpose.  Take the time
            not only to enjoy the present but also to look ahead to the future.
            Here are some of my hobbies, interests and career goals.</p>
        <h3>HOBBIES</h3>
        <p>My main hobby is training and running in triathlons. I have completed ten triathlons.
            Training is fun!  Who doesn't like enjoying the beauty of the morning outdoors. Taking
            a brisk walk, run, or bike ride is a great way to start the day and reset the mind. A 
            few days in the gym for some weight and balance training keeps the muscles strong. I
            don't know how many years I will be able to compete in triathlons, but I will always be acive.</p>

        <p> A few other hobbies of mine are:
             <ol>
                <li>playing competitive volleyball</li>
                <li>live music concerts</li>
                <li>biking</li>
                <li>traveling</li>
                <li>learning and exploring</li>
            </ol>
        <h3>INTERESTS</h3>
         <p>Outside of being active, I enjoy spending time with my family, helping others, photography and 
            computer photo editing. Taking photos and editing them for sharing to family or framing is really fun. 
            I may not be fast at editing but I continue to learn more every day. 
        </p>
        <h3>CAREER GOALS</h3>
        <p>My career goals are simple. Continue learning about web design, obtain a remote full time
            job where I can still be part of a team but have the ability to work at home or travel, be active and follow my 
            interests.  I look forward to the challenge of creating interesting, helpful, and creative websites
            that can be used on all media devices.
